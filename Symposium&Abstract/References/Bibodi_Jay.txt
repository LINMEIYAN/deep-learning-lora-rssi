This system will eliminate the need of intermediate platforms to publish pod-cast. The systems creates a new ERC-20 tokens named as 'Pods'. Users will have an ability to create account and get some specific amount of tokens (that is, Pods) as joining bonus to perform transaction in Ethereum network. 

Users will have an ability to upload podcast which could be either paid or free. User who uploads the podcast could decide the cost associated with the podcast. If cost associated with podcast is greater than 0 Pods then user will gain full profit without paying specific amount of share to different platforms like ios/google/spotify etc. Users will not only be able to search a specific podcast by it's name but also by tags associated with it.

User who uploaded a podcast will be able to see the list of users who purchased it and keep track of tokens received after each transaction in the ethereum network. User who purchased a podcast would have a option to like and post comments for the podcast. Comments are disabled from the system for free podcast but liking an free podcast could be done by any user being part of this system. This system will also allow users to purchase the tokens which could be used to buy a podcast.

The system will be implemented in Node js and Solidity will be used to write Smart Contract. Smart Contract will help us to exchange the 'Pods' token among the users while avoiding the services of the middlemen. This system also uses Stripe for payment gateway which will allow users to buy more tokens, Azure cosmos DB to store the metadata of the users and podcast information and AngularJS to develop highly responsive client side application with data-bindings.
